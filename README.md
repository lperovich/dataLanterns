# Open Water Data

The Open Water Data project explores new ways to experience environmental data as a community to increase collective understanding and engagement in important civic conversations. It helps make open source governmental data visible and accessible to community members, advocacy groups, and local governments and turns a critical eye on how open data sets about the environment are shared with the public: Who do these datasets serve and who could they serve? We share all the resources for creating an Open Water Data installation so that other communities can hold similar events and help us all better understand environmental contamination. 

### Chemicals in the Creek
In the Chemicals in the Creek Open Water Data installation, we floated data lanterns onto the Chelsea River in Massachusetts to create a physical representation of Clean Water Act violations by local oil storage facilities. The Clean Water Act (CWA) is a federal law that limits how much and what kinds of harmful chemicals can be put into waterways. From 2013-2017, the seven oil storage facilities in this area violated their CWA permits 76 times. We represent each of these violations with a lantern with a logo from the facility that the violation came from and that is color coded based on the chemical in violation. We hope these lanterns will shed light on the problem of chemicals being released into the creek and begin a community conversation about improving industrial accountability.

### Team

The Chemicals in the Creek installation is led by Laura Perovich (MIT), Sara Wylie (Northeastern Universities Social Science Environmental Health Research Institute), and Roseann Bongiovanni (GreenRoots). The installation was developed with GreenRoots' ECO youth crew and Leilani Mroczkowski from 2017-2018. Contact us if you'd like to create an new Open Water Data installations in your city! Or join our mailing list to find out about future events!

### Materials and Tutorials

All materials are provide here as open and reusable with credit. This includes:
1. Sample R code for gathering Clean Water Act Data from the ECHO website 
2. Sample dataset of NPDES numeric violations from oil storage facilites in Chelsea, MA from 2013-2017
3. Fabrication files: event brochures, event advertisements, year signs, custom seven-color LED board schematics, data lanterns parts lists
4. Detailed supplemental information about our data processes, the Clean Water Act, Environmental Justice, and other related issues.
